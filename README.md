# Third-Party APIs Challenge: Work Day Scheduler

The purpose of this repository is to create a dynamic and responsive application that will display a simple calendar which allows a user to save events for each hour of the day.

This application was created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Moment.js libraries and other moment alternatives with the help of a provided starter code.
